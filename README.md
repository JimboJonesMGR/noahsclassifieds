REBOOT - Noah Classifieds - This software was given to Yclas that qashed it. I have the source code and OG downloads. Yes it is an old project but it works! It works great on the newer hosting such as GoDaddy with solid state equipment. Yclass has been gobbling up the out of business competitors. 

History: Online Classified Ad software was very popular from 2000 to about 2014. The software format was developed and made available by different companies. They made money by implementing a FREMIUM model similar to online mobile games. Then Amazon real took hold in 2014 along with Google shopping. The next big competitor in the space was Walmart. People simply started using these platforms do to their advanced shipping, ease of access and large buyer pools.

The scripts for online classified ads are not relavent...or are they? Companies that made this script the core of their bussiness have went belly up around 2015 and 2016. Other online Classified companies have been buying or have been given the base code. This consolidation has lead to only a few scripts being left available. I have used Yclas and found it to be ok.

The problem I have had with Yclas is the port to a Wordpress type frame work. I can easily install Wordpress, apply a template and have Classified Ads type site. So Yclas seems to suffer from the same problem as its previous competition. It is not relavent as it once was. This is in no way a slight against Yclas. It works great. The Yclas team works hard to keep its script up to date. 

Below is the original warning from the FORK that Yclas has posted. They are pushing people to the open classifieds Yclas. 

***SNIPET***

  Now I have used the free version of Noah's Classified from 2013. It works flawlessly and is very fast. No issues when installed on GoDaddy hosting or Name.com hosting. Infact the reason I went looking for this script is because Name.com has a very sensitive shared hosting server. I have used the built in Softaculous from Cpanel and have gotten locked out of the server. If a script is not up to date and creates any kind of error or loop back their servers bann your IP address immediately. Then you have to use live chat and submit a ticket to get a live operator to let you back in.
  
  The point being it works great on Name.com and Godaddy.
  
  The Classified Ads development has been lacking for quite some time. As mentioned before with Amazon, eBay and Walmart as the main market places classified ads are not as popular. Craigslist takes up the rest of the market space. In 2016-2017 mobile apps LetGo and OfferUp released their flavor of classified ads for mobile platforms. LetGo who had better advertisement than OfferUp ultimately lost due to their customer relations. OfferUp consumed LetGo and consolidated the platforms. LetGo would not let users delete accounts without calling them.
  
  By adding Google AMP to your web hosting old scripts such as Noah Classifieds work great on the mobile platform. Due to their primative code structure they load super fast on Android and Apple. Infact they can be customized to actualy compete against OfferUp and Craigslist.
  
  CONCLUSION: Just because a script is old does not mean it is bad. I still use Microsoft Front Page Express that was packaged with Windos 98 SE. I use it every day to generate Index.html pages for domains that purchase. I do not want to use a parking page that uses my digital property to drive my traffic to the registar. It builds HTML 4 compliant webpages in just seconds. I use it to build other pages and resources for Noah Classified as well. Because it uses HTML 4 it is picked up by Google and the rest of the search industry almost instantly.
  
  Thank you for reading this far. I hope this helps other coders like me. I am always open to comment and suggestions.
